										<p>The case study I chose to look into is Malware Disruption found at the following link: [Case: Malware Disruption - ACM Ethics](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-malware-disruption/)

										<p>The Rogue Services provide we hosting services with guaranteed uptime no matter what and as some of their customers are independent web based retailers the majority of them are focused on malware and spam as well as several botnets protecting their malicious activities as well as their command-and-control servers.</p>
										<p>The case study is focused on the Rogue the violation of several principles of the Code of Ethics by allowing hosting of malicious software as well as different vulnerability tools as well as facilitating harm to other caused by their clients and failing to fight against malicious hosting and code. At the same time we can also focus on the malware developed to bring down the Rouge’s clients and network developed specifically for it.</p>
										<p>We can look at Roug’s failure to address the code of conduct or ethics according to  Bcs.org. (2022) which dictates that an organisation or individual have to carry out professional responsibility and due care and diligence in accordance with relevant authority while exercising professional judgement.</p>
										<p>At the same time if we look at the malware developed for bringing down the Roug’s network specifically while at the same time affecting no other ISP or customer conflicts the first point of BCS Code of Conduct which states that we should have regards of public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and their environment (Bcs.org. 2022) while non-malicious customer of Roug’s network were also affected and perhaps brought down legitimate business.</p>

											<h2>Unit 1 - Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 - Summary Post</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											<p>The Rogue Services has been a good example to learn from in regards to applied ethics and analysis.</p>

											<p>As it was pointed out by my colleague Hung Wei Lin (2022) shared views on the topic were presented in regards of violation of principles 2.5 (ACM, 2022) and substantial reduction of botnet traffic has been observed and a valid question was asked by my colleague if actions of computing proffessionals can cause a large scale damage to cybercriminals. When dealing with cybercriminals we have to do so in compliance with the law. </p>
											<p>The upper hand is that the cybercriminals do not abby the law and disregard it when law professional and practicians need to and have to do so in order to be successful in the courthouse.</p>
											<p>As Mathew Van Beek (2022) mentioned on his reply to my post Rouge disregards of principle 3.1 and did not act on public interest as well as failed to protect it’s customers that could have been shielded from such issue. Overall Rouges practices lead to affecting legitimate law abiding customers that were still affected by the exploit which ultimately brought the provider offline.</p>

												<h2>Reflective Activity Unit 1</h2>

											<p>

												<p>The week so far was really interesting starting off with week 1. I managed to learn a few things about my colelagues and their interests. My main area of interest is cybersecurity as I was studying and working in this field for some time and I belieev is the reason why I am now here. </p>
													<p>I believe taking advantage of survey taking could be a good way of understanding end user midset when it comes to Corporate Security and it is most likely the tool I would use. This will help me understand the human factor better when designing particular ways of protecting corporate network. </p>

													<p>The survay I have found online is a Christmas survay that focuses on gathering data about person’s holidays habbit. The main thing to address is the format which is fill in only as well as unchathegorized or unnumbered. For example on question which should be number four “Do you have a real or artificial Christmas Tree?” a different format could have been chosen by just selecting the appropriate answer. This helps the user interact faster with the question and not needing to type the answer resoulting in lless time spent on the survery.</p>
